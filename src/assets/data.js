I'm Alex Carter — a passionate designer and frontend developer who loves transforming ideas into visually engaging, user-friendly digital experiences.
Over the past few years, I've worked on a range of projects, from small business websites to full-scale web applications.
I believe great design is all about empathy, clarity, and purpose — creating interfaces that not only look good but feel effortless to use.
When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new design trends or experimenting with motion graphics.`,

I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with several startups and creative agencies as a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer.

Before that, I worked with PixelFrame Studio, where I helped build and optimize responsive web applications using React and Next.js.
I also enjoy mentoring junior designers and developers, helping them improve their eye for detail and technical execution.`,
